This is the first room in the Vulnerabilities Research Module where the focus is to: "Familiarize yourself with the skills, research methods, and resources used to exploit vulnerable applications and systems."

I won't go into as much detail in this room as I have in the previous posts. I will do a short summary about the information needed to answer the questions, but I feel that this room is pretty straight forward.

## Task 1: Introduction 
This room will go through the basics of what a vulnerability is and how they can be exploited for success in penetration testing.


## Task 2: Introduction To Vulnerabilities

__Definition of a Vulnerability accodring to NIST:__  “A weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source"

There are five main categories of vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability            | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System         | These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs)  <br> and often result in privilege escalation.                                   |
| (Mis)Configuration-based | These types of vulnerabilities stem from an incorrectly configured application <br> or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.        |
| Weak or Default Credentials | Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with <br> default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard <br> may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to <br> guess by an attacker. |
| Application Logic        | These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications.<br> For example, poorly  implemented authentication mechanisms that may result <br> in an attacker  being able to impersonate a user. |
| Human-Factor             | Human-Factor vulnerabilities leverage human behavior. <br> For example, phishing emails are designed  to trick humans into believing <br> they are legitimate.  |

## Task 3: Scoring Vulnerabilities (CVSS & VPR)
According to Kenna security only around 2% of vulnerabilities end up being exploited. It comes down to understanding the nature of the exploits and the damage it can cause. It might not be the right use of resources to patch a vulnerability that has no direct impact. There are two scoring systems aimed to help determine the risk and impact of a vulnerability, CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), and VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating).

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Common Vulnerability Scoring System or CVSS was first introduced in 2005 and is a popular framework for vulnerability scoring. The following factors are taken into consideration when scoring a vulnerability:
1. How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability?
2. Do exploits exist for this?
3. How does this vulnerability interfere with the CIA triad?

The vulnerabilities are given a rating between "None", "Low", "Medium", "High" and "Critical" depending on the score.

### Vulnerability Priority Rating
The Vulnerability Priority Rating (or VPR) framework is more modern and is more risk-driven. The scores given place a higher focus on the risk a vulnerability poses to the organization rather than imact for example. It also takes relevancy as a factor, so if the vulnerability is not relevant it does not pose a risk. It rates a vulnerability between "Low", "Medium", "High" and "Critical" depending on the score.

**Q: What year was the first iteration of CVSS published?**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
2005

**Q: If you wanted to assess vulnerability based on the risk it poses to an organisation, what framework would you use?**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
VPR

**Q: If you wanted to use a framework that was free and open-source, what framework would that be?**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
CVSS

## Task 4: Vulnerability Databases

Let's get the definitions straight:  
**Vulnerability:** A weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behavior of a system or application.  
**Exploit:** An action or behavior that utilizes a vulnerability on a system or application.  
**Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC is a technique or tool that often demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability.

In cyber security vulnerabilities are classified under "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures" (CVE), there are two main websites used to look up CVE:s 
* [NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln)
* [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

**Q: Using NVD, how many CVEs were published in July 2021?**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
1554, use advanced search and enter the date range.

**Q: Who is the author of Exploit-DB?**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
OffSec

## Task 5: An Example of Finding A Vulnerability
Sometimes versions of servers or systems are intentionally (or unintentionally) available. We will leverage the “Version Disclosure” vulnerability to find the version of an application. 

In the example given we find **Apache Tomcat 9.0.17** on a server. 

Exploit-db is handy to use for searching for software and versions, and we get a five hits when searching for _Tomcat 9.0_ in their database.

**Q: What type of vulnerability did we use to find the name and version of the application in this example?**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
Version Disclosure

### Task 6: Showcase: Exploiting Ackme's Application

Not much to say here, follow along with the website to get the flag!

### Task7: Conclusion
This room briefly looked at vulnerability research and two basic scoring strategies.

Let's go to the room in this module!
