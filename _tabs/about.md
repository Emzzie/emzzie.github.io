As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I believe that understanding the landscape of threats is essential to protecting our systems. I also believe that we will never know enough, and it’s vital to stay on top of the latest developments in the field—but in a curious and fascinated way. Let’s embrace the excitement of learning and be captivated by how the field continually evolves.

In this blog, I'll start off by sharing my experiences with Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and informational modules from TryHackMe (THM) and HackTheBox (HTB), as well as other topics that pique my interest. I’m a strong believer that the basics are essential, so I’ll do my best to break down complex concepts, highlighting foundational knowledge and explaining things in my own way. While I’m not an expert, I’ll share what I learn and what I already know, letting you follow along on this journey of discovery.

Let’s stay one step ahead of the threats and strengthen our defenses together!
